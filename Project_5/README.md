# Project 6 | Descriptive, predictive analysis and visualization in Tableau

The goals of this project is to develop the dashboard in Tableau that represents main insights (KPIs).
THe dashboard should reflect the domain and be useful for the decisionb-making.

There was no cleaning needed so there is no code

## Dataset introduction

Our dataset is about a superstore in the USA, that sells Office supplies, Technology and Furniture on 3 different segments in the USA. 
This dashboard is business oriented. 

## Big Aggregate Number
Depending on the years selected on the filters : 
- Total sales
- Total profit
- Total quantities sold 

These are key values we want to show in our dashboard. 

## Overall sales + Forecast
Line chart that visualizes the sales overs the 4 years, with a forecast for 2023.
We chose a line chart to show the seasonality of sales with monthly patterns. 

## Share of profit by category
We chose a pie chart to break down the profit by the 3 categories of product. 

## Total profit by region
We chose a bar chart to break down the profit by the 4 business regions. 
This allows us to sort the regions and visualize it easily. 

## Profitability by state
We created a map with a color scale to show the profit in each state. 
It shows very easily in which state is the company losing money. 

## Sub-category Profitability
This horizontal bar chart displays the profitability of each product sub-category. 
This type of charts allows us to rank the products and identify easily the unprofitable products.

## Average Profit by Average Discount Rate
We wanted to analyse the correlation between the average discount rate and the average profit, to identify if the company was not giving too much discounts. 
For that we have chosen a scatter plot with a regression line. 


## Frequency of Orders & Average Quantity per Order
We finally wanted to get an overview of what product sub-categories are ordered the most, and how much of these products are ordered on average. 
We chose packed bubbles to represent this, with the number of orders as the size of bubbles


## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.
1. code
2. Tableau dashboard
3. final dataset (clean one)
4. readme with widgets explanation

Note: no need of slides as you can use story instead.
